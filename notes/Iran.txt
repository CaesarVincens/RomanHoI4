A fascist Persian nation that is beginning to view itself as the unifier of 
	Iranian peoples. As such, It wants to conquer Baluchistan. It did rule
	part of Baluchistan before, but was forced to free it as a result of the
	Great War, in which it joined the other Asian powers (except for India,
	which worked with Rome). If it were to conquer Baluchistan, it might try
	for Kabul against India for the Pashtun people there. It would feel
	a cultural affinity for Chagatai, but most of Central Asia is Turkish,
	dividing them geographically.

It has some territory in Southern Africa, and used to have more, but Rome took
	it and gave it to Mutapa and South Africa. Like so many others, it lost
	Indonesian colonies to Rome, but still possesses some Pacific islands.
