Once the rulers of the Tibeten platau, Sichuan, Xinjian, and Urumqui, and a
	voracious foe of Ming, Tibet is now a rump state, soon to be absorbed by
	India. If somehow they survived that fate, they would be natural allies with
	Manchu, and temporary allies with Chagatai. With Chagatai they would contend
	over borders, but they agree with Manchu just what the division of Ming
	should be.

Tibet holds the distinction of being the weakest country in the world.
