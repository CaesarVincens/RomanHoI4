United by Norway, but at war with a breakaway state calling itself Norway but
	that is in the Kola peninsula. Occupies Russian territory east of Finland,
	territory with only Russians in it. Wants Ingria due to that region being
	Swedish. Wants the Jutland peninsula for historical reasons (the form 
	Scandinavia decision, I think), even though it's all Germans there. That may
	be dumb and I might change it.

Could be broken up into Norway, Sweden, and Finland, with Norway slightly
	larger than in our world.
