United by the Dutch with a capital in Amsterdam. Unity was a long, rocky
	journey. In 1931 lost territory to Scandinavia. Has lost territory to 
	Hungary. Hungary holds territory populated by south Germans that may
	never have been united (I don't have the saves handy, but could check if
	necessary). Has taken some Polish land.

The big cultural divisions are north German (with Denmark as a breakaway),
	south German (with Bavaria and Austria as breakaways), and Dutch (I need to
	add a breakaway). Burgundian is a Romano-German culture, so they have cores
	on much of Burgundy.

They definitely would be opposed to Hungary, but given their Vic2 performance 
	need allies. Poland-Lithuania is a choice, being their enemy's enemy, but
	PL is fascist, while Germany is a democracy (admittedly with a strong 
	fascist block). They also hold a PL state. They might return it, or maybe 
	discuss a population exchange with the Germans in Lublin and 
	Galicia-Lodomeria, which PL wants back from Hungary and fits more naturally
	in their borders.

Has some scattered cores due to German populations in PL and Russia, those I'll
	probably remove. Has some cores in the alps for the same reason, which might
	give it motivation to take advantage of Rome's latest civil war and invade
	Rhaetia.
