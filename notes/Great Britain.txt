Another Roman breakaway during the Great War. Started as Communist, but a 
	revolution turned it democratic, which it has remained.

Not sure what to do with it.

Note that the English culture is a minority in Great Britain, they migrated to
	South America or assimilated. Except for London, Canterbury, and Newcastle.
	Nevertheless, English is the primary culture (this might silently change).
	Welsh is it's own national identity over in southern Wales, but hasn't been 
	independent in centuries.
