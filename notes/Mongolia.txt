Mongolia doesn't actually exist in Vic2, but by golly they pop out on the
	cultural map mode, and there's even "Oirat Horde" rebels in Manchu's
	Mongolian territory, outnumbering Manchu army in that part of the nation,
	and with no-one providing access for the rest of the army (which only
	matches the rebels) to try to help.
