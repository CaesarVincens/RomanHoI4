When Rome began colonizing the New World, they attempted the Greek method of 
	colonization in antiquity: send a bunch of people who build a new city
	wholesale, trade manufactured goods to the locals for food, and become the
	rulers of the region by dint of having the city. This failed. The settlers
	suffered from horrible diseases and proved unprepared for the climates of
	the New World. The locals quickly took the opportunity to set up their own
	trading posts and cities instead, absorbing any further settlers in the
	locals' system. From Rome's perspective, it was much the same, as the locals
	found being a part of Rome's political system and trade networks to be
	advantageous.

England was also colonizing, even as their homeland was being conquered by
	Rome. When Rome offered to give them much of northeastern South America in
	exchange for all claims on British territory, they took the deal. There
	was a veritable flood of English to the New World (the only significant
	populations of English people in the Old World are in London, Canterbury,
	and Newcastle-upon-Tyne). England brought the South American coast under
	their control and continued colonizing. The New England region of the UTA
	was settled by the English before the UTA and Rome forced them out of North
	America. They still control a significant portion of the West African coast.

In the last 100 years, England has come to control most of the Amazon. When
	they formed a border with Colombia, they forcibly took most Colombian
	territory east of the Andes. They are currently in a war to take Amazonian
	territory from Biru.
