An Orthodox Bedouin nation (Islam got pushed into India in this world).
	Conquered part of Iraq awhile back. Currently in Rome's sphere, but over the
	last century Rome has fought a number of minor wars to take away their 
	colonies	in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Tainan, so I can't image they're
	happy	about it. They, Oman, and Iraq have the potential to form a united
	Arab nation, despite being different kinds of Arabs. This would give them
	some claims on Ethiopia due to some Arab enclaves. If that seems silly, the
	cores could easily be removed.

Currently has revolts from both fascists and Arab Pan-nationalists. Both of
	those are equally sized, and both are larger than Hedjaz's military. The
	people are largely fascist.
