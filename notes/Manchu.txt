Manchu was once masters of the areas north of China and northern China itself.
	They have been squeezed between Russia and Ming, and now only hold what we
	would call Vladivostok and eastern Mongolia. If they were to spring back,
	they view themselves as the rightful rulers of all the traditional Chinese
	lands.
