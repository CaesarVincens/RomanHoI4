When Rome began colonizing the New World, they attempted the Greek method of 
	colonization in antiquity: send a bunch of people who build a new city
	wholesale, trade manufactured goods to the locals for food, and become the
	rulers of the region by dint of having the city. This failed. The settlers
	suffered from horrible diseases and proved unprepared for the climates of
	the New World. The locals quickly took the opportunity to set up their own
	trading posts and cities instead, absorbing any further settlers in the
	locals' system. From Rome's perspective, it was much the same, as the locals
	found being a part of Rome's political system and trade networks to be
	advantageous.

Colombia was the resulting district in the northwest of South America. It
	formed a North Andean identity. It has suffered over the last century,
	with England invading and taking most of its territory east of the Andes,
	and Biru taking Cauca. The floods of English settlers would make 
	reintegrating Guaviere and Bolivar a long-term project even if they could
	be recovered. And the population of Cauca is now evenly split between
	Quecha and North Andeans, even though Colombia has recovered the state.	And
	while Colombia is the ruler of the isthmus connecting the American
	continents, England is in firm control of the canal they built there.

Colombia's goals would be to recover its lost territory and control the canal,
	but it is the weak nation in South America.
