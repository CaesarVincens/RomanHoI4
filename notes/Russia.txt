A democracy, but not necessarily a peaceful one. Has conquered Ukraine (which
	is shaped a bit different in this world), and has made inroads into Central
	Asia. Has taken a bit of Poland-Lithuania (what we would consider Latvia and
	Estonia). Wants territory back from Scandinavia. Wants what we would call 
	Vladivostok from Manchu, and would probably take the rest of Mongolia in the
	bargain. Wants Sakhalin from Japan. Would love to push Rome south to the 
	Caucasus, and wouldn't you know, there's about to be a civil war leaving
	that region to it's own devices. I'm not sure if it'd take the chance to 
	anchor itself on the Carpathians while it was at it.

It's currently supporting England (with Adal's support too) in England's
	invasion of Biru (with Mexhico defending Biru). Russia isn't really involved
	thanks to its lack of a fleet.

Ukraine can be completely freed, and once I add it so can Mongolia. Or at least
	the half of Mongolia Russia currently occupies.
