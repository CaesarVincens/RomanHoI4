Chagatai views itself as the ruler of eastern Central Asia, into what we would
	consider the Xinjiang region. They do not have designs on Turkish territory,
	so they aren't inclined to fight with Khiva, but Khiva is inclined to fight
	with them. Most of the territory they have designs on does not have 
	populations that they would view as a cultural fit, however.
