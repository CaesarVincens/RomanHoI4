Benin is a country consisting of and ruled by the Yoruba people. They rule over
	the Ibo,	the Edo, and the Ibibo. Long protected by Rome and well within 
	Rome's sphere of influence, it remains much like it did centuries ago, in no
	ways prepared for the modern world. Though if it somehow did reform, it 
	would desire to take the Yoriba states from Sokoto, maybe even Ngaoundere,
	uniting the Yoruba people entirely.
