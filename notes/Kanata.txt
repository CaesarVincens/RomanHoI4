The Huron's interactions with Rome led to them adopting Orthodox Christianity
	and radically reforming their societal structure. They formed a new nation
	uniting the various cultures of northern North America and rapidly convinced
	new villages and tribes to join. During this period of expansion they
	competed with the UTA a little, but that has now all been resolved. They
	lost Washington to the UTA as a result of the Great War, but Huron people
	have been emigrating from there or assimilating, so there is not much sense
	in trying to recover it.
