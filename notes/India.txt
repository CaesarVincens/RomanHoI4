India has united in the last century (if I recall, under the political efforts
	of Rome). They've done some colonization in Southeast Asia, and is currently
	invading Tibet. They certainly want the part of Kashmir east of the
	Himalayas, but will probably take the Lhasa region, though maybe it would be
	worth splitting that state so that they focus on the Himalayas there, and
	leave the rest for China.

India is one of the few multi-religious nations in the world. They are ruled by
	Muslims, but also have Orthodox, Hindu, and Buddhist peoples.

I've left some of the culture-specific nations forming it as releasables for 
	now, but could be willing to remove them. If they were released, it'd
	probably end up a mess of overlapping claims. These include Travancore,
	Sindh, Rajputana, Panjab, Orissa, Nepal, Malwa, Khandash, Kashmir, Gujarat,
	Ceylon, Bastar, Assam.
