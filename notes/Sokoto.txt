Sokoto was long ago united by the Bambara people, who rule over the Hausa,
	those Yoruba not part of Benin, the Fon, the Fulbe, the Kanuri, the Songhai,
	the Tiv, and a patchwork of more minor peoples. Under Roman protecion and in
	Rome's economic sphere, they have formed a mostly modern nation with some 
	degree of representation.
