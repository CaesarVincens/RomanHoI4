Biru is the continuation of the old Inca Empire. Like other New World polities,
	it happily received Roman missionaries and advisers, reforging itself as a
	strong Christian power. It has long dominated the majority of the Andes,
	but has fallen on rough times. It has fought or is fighting most of its
	neighbours in recent years: Colombia took back some Colombian territory,
	Argentina conquered the southern Andes, and England seems intent of taking
	the rest of the Amazon.
