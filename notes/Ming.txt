The great and ancient Empire of the East, Ming has ruled China for over 500
	years. In the 14th-18th centuries, they may have lost territory to Wu in the
	south, Tibet in the west, and Manchu in the north, but the core always
	remained strong. They have since fought back against all three. There are
	remnants of Manchu and Tibet, to be sure, but those will not last long.

Culturally, they are Chinese, and the vast majority of the country is, too.
	The well integrated Mukden and Qiqihar provinces in the north are largely
	Manchu. The well integrated Qinghai and Sichuan regions have many Tibetans.
	The recently conquered Katmandu region is poorly integrated and fully
	Tibetan. The future of Tibet is uncertain, with India invading the Lhasa
	region. Hanoi province is also a recent conquest, and peopled by the 
	Vietnamese.

China has no immediate territorial goals, except perhaps the remains of Tibet,
	or to incorporate Mongolia. They might return to their traditional method of
	forming tributary states, or focus on internal development.
