In Vic2, Burgundy broke away from Rome during the Great War under the 
	leadership of someone claiming to be the Pope (Catholicism is a minor 
	religion in this timeline).

They have since reformed into a democracy of the Prussian Constituionalist 
	form. That is, the form of democracy with little of the substance.

They've taken territory from Flanders-Wallonia, France, and Aquitaine, so are
	clearly very aggressive.

As Italy was first allied then in a PU with them, a possible path is to borrow 
	from the Austria-Hungary items in HoI4 and have them unite and form the	Holy
	Roman Empire. It's a tenuous connection to the historical HRE at best, but
	gives them an excuse to try and carve out an empire.

And if it matters, Burgundian is a Germanic-Roman fusion culture.
