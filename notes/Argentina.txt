When Rome began colonizing the New World, they attempted the Greek method of 
	colonization in antiquity: send a bunch of people who build a new city
	wholesale, trade manufactured goods to the locals for food, and become the
	rulers of the region by dint of having the city. This failed. The settlers
	suffered from horrible diseases and proved unprepared for the climates of
	the New World. The locals quickly took the opportunity to set up their own
	trading posts and cities instead, absorbing any further settlers in the
	locals' system. From Rome's perspective, it was much the same, as the locals
	found being a part of Rome's political system and trade networks to be
	advantageous.

Argentina was the Roman region in the southeast of South America, and formed
	a Platinean identity. It became independent during the interregnum before
	Empress Veronica's rule. It recently took the southernmost stretches of
	the Andes from Biru, and is working on integrating these territories.
