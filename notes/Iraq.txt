A communist nation in the Roman sphere, with largely a largely fascist
	population. It's been occupied by both Persia and Hedjaz in the last
	century, with Rome restoring things. But Rome also took it's Indonesian
	colonies, so it can't be happy about that.

Largely Mashriqi Arab (as with the other Arabs, Orthodox in religion), but
	could be united in a pan-Arabic movement.
