Italy was another Roman breakaway during the Great War. It was initially ruled
	by a King, but after his assassination was in a loose personal union under
	Burgundy. Both of those were repressive reactionary governments.

After 1927, it fell to a series of revolts.
	Jan 1, 1931: it was fascist, with communist and jacobins rebels
	Nov 1, 1931: it was democratic with the fascist party in control of the 
		government, and communist rebels
	Jun 1, 1934: it was democratic, with liberals in control of the government
		no rebels

Its political reforms are somewhat weak and its social reforms pretty bad,so it
	seems ripe for more revolution, or for a Burgundian takeover. Or maybe even 
	a Roman takeover if it comes in time.
