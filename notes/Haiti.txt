When Rome began colonizing the New World, they attempted the Greek method of 
	colonization in antiquity: send a bunch of people who build a new city
	wholesale, trade manufactured goods to the locals for food, and become the
	rulers of the region by dint of having the city. This failed. The settlers
	suffered from horrible diseases and proved unprepared for the climates of
	the New World. The locals quickly took the opportunity to set up their own
	trading posts and cities instead, absorbing any further settlers in the
	locals' system. From Rome's perspective, it was much the same, as the locals
	found being a part of Rome's political system and trade networks to be
	advantageous.

Haiti was a governing region covering the two largest Caribbean islands. During
	the interregnum before Empress Veronica's reign, Haiti drifted out of Rome's
	political system and control. It formed a more Caribeno identity, but
	suffered politically. In 1919, it suffered a simultaneous fascist revolt on 
	Cuba and a communist revolt on Hispaniola. The communists took the capital
	city of Port Au Prince, but the fascists have controlled Cuba for the last
	sixteen years. As a result of these civil wars, Haiti is the poorest nation
	of the western hemisphere. It has no ambitions beyond its own border, merely
	hoping to see peace return.
