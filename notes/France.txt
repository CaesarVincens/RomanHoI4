Another Roman breakaway during the Great War. It started as Communist, and was
	allied with both Great Britain and Brittany. The British alliance fell 
	through as Great Britain fell to revolutions. In 1916, Burgundy invaded, 
	taking Champaign. Soon, there were revolts from jacobins and
	Flanders-Wallonian nationalists. Both succeeded, freeing part of the Walloon
	part of Flanders-Wallonia and instituting a democracy. There was a communist
	counter-revolution despite maxed social reforms. Anarcho-Liberals rose up in
	a counter-counter-revolution. But by 1921 all forces were defeated and the 
	last strongholds were being pacified. Then before 1922 was out somehow it 
	became Radical and was invading Flander-Wallonia. It succeeded in the 
	invasion and had no more revolutions.

I'm not sure what to do with France. The triple-Communist alliance would have
	been something, but that's fallen apart. Maybe they'd go for Brittany,
	which is still communist? Burgundy seems to strong to strike back at unless
	something else happens. A German alliance, perhaps?
