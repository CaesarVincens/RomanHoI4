Rome has had several territories break away during the Great War. It starts 
	HoI4 with a new civil war.

Once that war is over, it's goals will be to:
1) Reunite its core territory (the traditional Roman borders):
	Algeria
	Aquitaine
	Armenia
	Azerbaijan
	Brittany
	Burgundy
	Catalonia
	Dalmatia (Yugoslavia)
	Egypt
	Flanders-Wallonia (Belgium)
	France
	Georgia
	Great Britain (not to be confused with England, which is South American)
	Israel
	Italy
	Moesia Inferior (Romania)
	Moesia Superior (Serbia)
	Morocco
	Pannonia
	Raetia (Switzerland)
	Sicily
	Spain
	Syria
	Tripoli
	Tunis
Democratic Rome would likely be willing to accept a more gradual integration, 
	Absolutist more willing to outright invade.
As the AAR will likely be semi-interactive, even the Democratic form might be
	aggressive, especially for this goal.
2) Bring its further flung territory back:
	* Angola - was a satellite, not incorporated
	* Aeteorea (New Zealand) - was a satellite, not incorporated
	* Australia
	* Burkina Faso
	* Cameroon
	* Chad
	* Congo - was a satellite, not incorporated
	* Dahomey
	* Gabon - was a satellite, not incorporated
	* Guinea
	* Guyenne
	* Java
	* Mali
	* Mataram (might be combined with Java)
	* Mauritania
	* Namibia - was a satellite, not incorporated
	* Niger
	* Philippines
	* Senegal
	* South Africa - was a satellite, not incorporated
	* Togo
3) Re-sphere some nations?:
	* Benin
	* Cambodia
	* Ethiopia
	* Hedjaz
	* Iraq
	* Mutapa
	* Oman
	* Sokoto
4) The more extreme factions (absolutists or fascists) might even try to bring
	back the pre-Vic2 colonies:
	* Argentina
	* Colombia
	* Haiti
5) The less extreme factions (democracy) might presumably brought back the 
	further territories with a light hand, and might push for decolonization 
	from other powers.
6) If brought into opposition with Russia, there's lots of reason to push for 
	Ukraine's freedom.
7) The democratic government would try to form the UN (maybe not a faction, 
	maybe just flavor).
8) The absolutist government might try and gain control of the whole world.
